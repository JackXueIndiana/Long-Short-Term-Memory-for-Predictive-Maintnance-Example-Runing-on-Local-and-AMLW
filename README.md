# Long-Short-Term-Memory-for-Predictive-Maintnance-Example-Runing-on-Local-and-AMLW
This article shows you how to prepare and run the Deep learning algorithm from Microsfot CNTK to build a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model for auro-engine maintenance. The code is from Dr. Uz's post.

Dr. Uz published a blob on how LSTM can help resolving the predictive maintnace problem in 2017. Here is the link: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/deep-learning-for-predictive-maintenance/
The Python notebook is at https://github.com/Azure/lstms_for_predictive_maintenance/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20Basics%20for%20Predictive%20Maintenance.ipynb

AS my learning process, I am trying to run her code on my PC on which Anaconda Python 3 has been installed.
